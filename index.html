            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>My name is Daniel Richmond, a long-time Healthare Administrator who, at 39 years of age, decided to delve into software engineering!</p>
            <p>I have lived in many placecs. Born in Anchorage, Alaska, I moved to Fresno, California in 1986. It was in 1998- my high school graduation year- I decided to move to Franklin, Tennessee. Though my previous consulting career had me relocate
                to a number of other states, I always end up back in Tennessee.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Well into my term working in the healthcare industry, I held a Project Manager role for the design and development of a telemedicine platform and EHR for the eldercare industry.</p>
            <p><em>It was the first of its kind... and I was a part of it!</em></p>
            <p>I partnered with the IT profesional who directed the technical developments and quickly found myself fascinated by what he was able to create with some words on a screen. That's what started my interest in software engineering, though it has
                grown, immensely, since. There is something to say about being able to see the results of something you create- visually!</p>
            <p>I've always been a people person, ever since a child. I was "the" social butterfly.</p>
            <p> Working in team settings came naturally. This natural ability has fostered my career's growth and led to many valuable friendships.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i><b>Outside of web development, I do have some hobbies I enjoy.</b></i></p>

                <li><i>Movies! I love them. At home or at a theater, they're a great escape.</i></li>
                <li><i>I enjoy going for walks, particularly in the late afternoon. Gives me a chance to watch the sun go down for the day.</i></li>
                <li><i>I love working out, though I don't get to do that quite as often as I once did.</i></li>
            </ul>
